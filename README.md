# fall_detector
Detect potential falls (from bike) from a GPX (exploring feature Strava has implemented)

# Background

One day I uploaded bike ride to Strava and was surprised when their new AI summary feature suggested I had fallen off my bike (I had).

So I thought I'd explore how you might do this yourself.

This script is a quick method of doing so in Python.

Aider and Cursor IDE helped me write the script.
